            <p class="p1">A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, born on 15th October 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, hailed from a humble Tamil Muslim family. His father was a boat owner and mosque imam, and his mother was a housewife. Despite ancestral affluence, the family faces financial hardship. Abdul Kalam even sold newspaper to help support the family.</p>
            <p class="p2">Kalam, a diligent student, exhibited a strong thirst for knowledge. After completing his schooling, he pursued physics at St. Josephâ€™s College and graduated in 1954. He furthered his education at Madras Institute of Technology, where his resilience was evident when he met a project deadline facing scholarship loss.</p>
